# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
I write some Python classes for solving the TSP with simulated annealing.



## Inner Method

With this method you can write the costs or the distance between cities

### Example for Inner Method

First you should give the Temperature, Cooling Rate and the Iteration number then programme will ask you for the distances and the other calculations will be done when you give the distances.

You can see how the model works

## Outer Method

With this method first you should create a numpy array and then you give the array with other parameters for the optimization

### Example for Outer Method

First the array is created and then given with the Temperature, Cooling Rate and the Iteration number and the all optimization steps will be done.
